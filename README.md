# Quamium
A simple web browser application written in GO

This project is based on the Web Browser Engineering book by Pavel Panchekha & Chris Harrelson
It can be found online here: https://browser.engineering/

While the book is written in python, I was interested in learning golang as I understand it is a useful 
language for both scripting and application development, so I will be using this project as both a jump
in the deep end introduction to golang and a more involved programming project to get me comfortable
developing larger scale projects. My end goal is to use what I learn here to help contribute to the 
Ladybird browser project, which can be found here: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird
